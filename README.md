# REAL SAN FRANCISCANS

## Story

[Someone made a sidewalk-graffiti statement](http://uptownalmanac.com/2014/04/confused-valencia-street-now-segregating-techies-and-real-san-franciscans) about who counts as a "real" San Franciscans -- not techies, apparently. I was inspired by an [update to the graffiti](http://uptownalmanac.com/2014/04/local-street-artist-pretty-much-over-everyone) to make a little app to let anyone choose who doesn't belong in SF.

Works best in latest versions of Chrome.
